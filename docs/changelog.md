# Changelog

All notable changes to SecantusDB are documented here. This file is the
**system of record** for what shipped in each release — the per-release
blog posts on [secantusdb.com](https://secantusdb.com/categories/releases.html)
are generated from these entries via `tools/generate_blog_post.py`.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
with one extension: each release carries a one-to-three-paragraph **prose
lede** between the date line and the structured `#### Added` /
`#### Changed` / `#### Fixed` subsections. The prose lede is what the
blog generator lifts verbatim as the marketing-post body, so it should
read as a self-contained narrative — not as "v0.5.1bN ships X."

This project adheres roughly to [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), but while we're in
beta the patch number `bN` rolls forward on every PyPI-visible push;
the API surface itself is shaped by Semantic Versioning intent.

## [Unreleased]

### `secantusdb.toml` config file, native checkpoint restore, j:true durability knob

Two production-shaping slices land together. A new
`secantusdb.toml` configuration file exposes every CLI flag plus
the WT and oplog knobs that were previously hard-coded — including
`cache_size` (so you can size the engine for your dataset instead
of running with the 1 GB test default) and a `sync_on_commit`
switch that closes the long-standing `writeConcern: {j: true}`
durability gap by enabling WT's per-commit fsync. The loader
auto-discovers `./secantusdb.toml`, `~/.secantus/secantusdb.toml`,
and `/etc/secantus/secantusdb.toml`; an explicit `--config PATH`
overrides the search. CLI flags still win over file values, so the
file is a deployment baseline rather than a lock-in.

A new `secantusAdmin.restoreArchive` wire command and matching
`secantusdb-restore-archive` offline CLI close out the backup
story started in b18 — extract a backup `.tar.gz` into a target
directory the operator then points a fresh SecantusDB process at.
The admin UI's per-row Restore button now adapts to backup type:
mongodump directories still call `mongorestore`; native `.tar.gz`
archives surface an inline target-dir field and an Extract action
that hits the new endpoint. Restore intentionally doesn't try to
swap the WT home under a running server (the connection-thread
session-caching layer would need a wholesale rework first), and
matches how real mongod restore tooling already trains operators.

Drive-by fix: the admin UI's "Existing backups" list now also
includes `.tar.gz` files. The native archives created by the b18
backup button were previously invisible because `list_backups`
only enumerated directories.

The new [Running in production](production.md) doc page ties the
config-file, native-backup, and restore work together — honest
comparison vs single-node Postgres (the more useful framing than
"SecantusDB vs mongod"), the gaps you have to accept, and a
concrete `systemd` / TLS / backup / monitoring deployment shape.

#### Added

- [Running in production](production.md) docs page — honest
  comparison vs single-node Postgres (the more useful framing than
  "SecantusDB vs mongod-for-prod"), the gaps you must accept (no
  native TLS, no PITR, no replication, beta maturity), and a
  concrete deployment shape: `systemd` unit, `secantusdb.toml`
  with `sync_on_commit = true`, SCRAM auth provisioning, nginx
  stream TLS termination, hourly native checkpoint backups with
  off-host sync, the restore drill, `serverStatus` scraping for
  Prometheus / Datadog, and capacity sizing notes for
  `cache_size`.
- `secantusdb.toml` configuration file (see
  [Configuration](configuration.md) for the full schema). Auto-
  discovered from `./secantusdb.toml`,
  `~/.secantus/secantusdb.toml`, `/etc/secantus/secantusdb.toml`;
  `--config PATH` disables discovery and loads a specific file.
  Unknown keys / unknown top-level tables fail loudly at startup
  so typos can't silently leave the engine running on the
  hard-coded default.
- `secantus.config.SecantusConfig` dataclass + `load_config()` /
  `apply_overrides()` helpers. CLI flags' argparse defaults are
  now `None` (the "user did not pass this" sentinel) so the
  precedence chain is `SecantusConfig defaults < secantusdb.toml
  < explicit CLI flag` — file is a per-deployment baseline, the
  CLI overrides for one-off runs.
- New CLI flags exposing previously-hard-coded knobs:
  `--cache-size`, `--session-max`, `--sync-on-commit`,
  `--oplog-retention-seconds`, `--oplog-max-entries`. Each has a
  matching `[storage]` / `[oplog]` key in the config file.
- `Storage.__init__` accepts `cache_size`, `session_max`,
  `sync_on_commit` kwargs. The WT engine config string is built
  from these instead of being a hard-coded literal.
- `secantusAdmin.restoreArchive` wire command. Accepts
  `archivePath` (server-side path to `.tar.gz`), `targetDir`
  (extraction destination), and optional `allowExisting` (overlay
  into a non-empty dir). Returns `{targetDir, fileCount, archive,
  ok: 1}`. RBAC: `fsync` action, cluster scope.
- `secantus.storage.extract_backup_archive(archive_path,
  target_dir, *, allow_existing=False)` — module-level helper
  shared by the wire command, the admin route, and the CLI.
  Validates that the archive contains a `WiredTiger` metadata
  file before unpacking, so a malformed tarball can't pollute the
  target.
- `secantusdb-restore-archive` console script (new `[project.scripts]`
  entry). Same validation as the wire command, no server needed.
- Admin UI per-row **Extract** action on `.tar.gz` rows, posting
  to `POST /backup/restore-archive` with editable target-dir form
  field; the existing `Restore` button still handles mongodump
  directories.

#### Changed

- `writeConcern: {j: true}` is now honourable end-to-end via
  `[storage] sync_on_commit = true` (or `--sync-on-commit`),
  which sets WT's `transaction_sync=(enabled=true,method=fsync)`.
  Closes the long-standing durability gap previously documented
  in the backlog. Off by default (matches mongod's default
  `{w:1, j:false}`) since the throughput cost is significant.
- `secantus.admin.backup.list_backups()` now includes
  `*.tar.gz` files alongside directories. Native-archive backups
  produced by b18's backup button were previously invisible in
  the admin UI's "Existing backups" list.
- `MongoFacade.restore_archive(archive_path, target_dir, *,
  allow_existing=False)` — new admin client facade method.

#### Fixed

- "Existing backups" table on `/backup` was silently dropping
  every `.tar.gz` produced by the native checkpoint backup path
  introduced in v0.5.1b18 (only dump *directories* were listed).
  Both kinds now render with the correct per-row restore action.

## [0.5.1b18] — 2026-05-18

### Native WT-checkpoint backups, admin UI /oplog page, and change-stream fidelity wins

The natural follow-on to v0.5.1b17's `local.oplog.rs` synthetic
collection lands as the admin UI `/oplog` page: a paged entry
browser with a window selector (last 50 / 500 / 5000), `op`-checkbox
filter (`i` / `u` / `d` / `c` / `n`), `ns` substring filter, and a
per-row expandable JSON body. Auto-refreshes every 5 s. The data
source is just `client.local.oplog_rs.find()` — no new server-side
surface needed, only the page chrome and an `_rows` partial that
follows the same pattern as `/connections` + `/cursors`.

`showExpandedEvents` on change streams now matches mongod: the flag
defaults to `false`, and DDL "expanded" events (`createIndexes`,
`dropIndexes`) are suppressed unless the user opts in via
`coll.watch(show_expanded_events=True)`. Previously these surfaced
unconditionally — more permissive than mongod, and broke the
conformance contract for tests that assume the stable v1 event set.

`killOp` lands as a real wire command that closes the target
connection's socket via `shutdown(SHUT_RDWR)`. Any in-flight command
finishes, the per-connection thread's next `recv` returns 0, the
loop exits, and the connection unregisters cleanly. Real mongod uses
a per-op interrupt flag, which would need cancellation infrastructure
SecantusDB doesn't carry — but "close the socket" is the visible
end-state users care about, and the kill-and-reap admin button on
`/connections` is now functional.

`$sample` becomes deterministic when `SECANTUS_SAMPLE_SEED=<n>` is
set in the environment. Builds a dedicated `random.Random(seed)`
instance at module load instead of mutating the global `random`
state, so other code sharing the process keeps its own entropy.
Closes the long-standing test-flake source where `$sample` results
varied run-to-run.

#### Added
- Admin UI `/oplog` page (`routers/oplog.py` +
  `templates/pages/oplog.html` + `templates/partials/oplog_rows.html`):
  window / op / ns filters, expandable per-row JSON, 5 s
  auto-refresh, sidebar entry between Profiler and Maintenance.
- `killOp` wire command + `kill(conn_id)` on
  `ConnectionRegistry` (shuts down the socket via
  `shutdown(SHUT_RDWR)`). Per-connection sockets are now stashed on
  the registry at `_handle_client` time.
- `A_KILLOP` privilege action in `secantus.rbac`; granted by
  `clusterAdmin` and `root`.
- Admin UI `/connections` Kill button (was a placeholder),
  typed-confirm modal (`partials/connection_kill_modal.html`),
  facade `kill_connection(conn_id)` method.
- `ChangeStreamSpec.show_expanded_events` parsed from
  `$changeStream.showExpandedEvents`; threaded into
  `changestreams.project`.
- `SECANTUS_SAMPLE_SEED` env var (read at `aggregate` module
  import) — `$sample` uses a dedicated `random.Random(seed)`
  when set.
- `secantusAdmin.backupArchive` wire command + `Storage.create_archive`
  + admin UI "Run native checkpoint backup" button: forces a WT
  checkpoint then tars the storage directory into a single
  `.tar.gz`. Faster + atomic vs `mongodump`; restore is "extract
  + start a new SecantusDB pointing at it". Rigorous round-trip
  test coverage in `tests/test_backup_restore.py` (doc identity at
  scale, every non-default index shape, oplog tail continuity,
  capped collection options + FIFO state, SCRAM users / roles,
  concurrent-writes consistency, archive portability, repeated-
  backup idempotency).
- `$densify` month / quarter / year units via
  `dateutil.relativedelta`. `quarter` is canonically 3 months.
  Adds `python-dateutil>=2.8` to the runtime dependencies (pure
  Python, available almost everywhere as a transitive dep).

#### Changed
- `changestreams.project` suppresses `createIndexes` / `dropIndexes`
  events unless the caller passed `show_expanded_events=True`
  (mongod-faithful default-off). The three existing tests +
  cross-driver DDL smokes (mongosh / node / go / java) all set the
  opt-in.

#### Fixed
- Closes backlog entry `$sample uses random.sample without a fixed
  seed` — deterministic via env var.
- Closes backlog entry `killOp / connection-close command` — admin
  UI Kill button is functional.
- Closes backlog entry `showExpandedEvents — accepted, ignored`.
- Closes backlog entry `Admin UI /oplog page`.
- `updateDescription.truncatedArrays` now emits for any array
  shrink (not just strict head-prefix), with indexed ``updatedFields``
  for kept-prefix changes — matches mongod's $v:2 in-place diff
  rather than wholesale-replacing on any reshape. Same-length-with-
  changes arrays also produce indexed ``arr.<i>`` updates now
  (previously wholesale). Closes the §3.2 backlog entry.

## [0.5.1b17] — 2026-05-17

### `local.oplog.rs` queryable from pymongo, `$merge` pipeline form + `$fill` stage + `$$var.path` resolution

Real mongod exposes the oplog as a queryable collection at
`local.oplog.rs` — pymongo clients can `db.oplog.rs.find()` against
it the same way they would against any collection. Until this release,
SecantusDB's oplog was internal only: `Storage.read_oplog` /
`oplog_floor_seq` / `oplog_tail_seq` were Python methods but had no
wire surface. Now `local.oplog.rs` is a synthetic read-only view —
`list_collections("local")` surfaces it, `find` / `count` /
`listCollections.options` route to a reader that walks the oplog WT
table directly, and write attempts (`insert`, `update`, `delete`,
`findAndModify`, `drop`, `create`, `createIndexes`) refuse with code
13 (Unauthorized) like mongod does. The deferred admin UI `/oplog`
page is unblocked as a follow-up; for now, debugging an in-flight
change-stream pipeline is as simple as
`client.local.oplog_rs.find({"op": "u"}).sort("ts", -1).limit(20)`.

The aggregation expression library picks up two of the three remaining
stages on most "more stages" wishlists. `$merge` was partly
implemented; this batch fills in the rest: `whenMatched: [<pipeline>]`
runs a sub-pipeline against the matched target doc with `$$new` bound
to the source doc and any user `let` vars threaded through;
`whenMatched: "delete"` (MongoDB 5.0+) removes the matched doc; a
unique-index guard refuses non-`_id` `on` fields without a `unique:
true` index covering them, matching mongod's rule against silent
on-field collapse.

`$fill` lands fresh — the 5.3+ stage for filling missing/null fields.
Three modes per output field: `{value: <expr>}` replaces with an
evaluated expression; `{method: "locf"}` carries the last observation
forward within the partition's sortBy order; `{method: "linear"}`
interpolates between bracketing non-null anchors along the sortBy field
(works for numbers and datetimes — timedelta arithmetic divides cleanly
to float and multiplies back to timedelta). Partitioning via
`partitionByFields` or `partitionBy`; sortBy required when any output
uses `method`.

The `$merge` pipeline form was the first thing in the repo to exercise
`$$var.path` (e.g. `$$new.delta`), and surfaced that the expression
evaluator only did exact-name var lookup. Fixed in the same batch:
`$$var.field.path` now walks the dotted path into the resolved value
across `$$ROOT.f` / `$$CURRENT.f` / user-let vars.

#### Added
- `local.oplog.rs` synthetic collection: queryable via `find` /
  `count` / `listCollections`. Walks the existing oplog WT table via
  a private session for cross-thread visibility. `list_databases`
  surfaces `local` whenever the oplog is enabled.
- `$merge whenMatched: [<pipeline>]` with `$$new` binding + `let` clause
  for user-defined vars (`aggregate._stage_merge`).
- `$merge whenMatched: "delete"` (MongoDB 5.0+).
- `$merge` unique-index guard on non-`_id` `on` fields.
- `$fill` stage with `value`, `locf`, and `linear` modes
  (`aggregate._stage_fill`).
- `$$var.field.path` dotted-path resolution in
  `expressions._resolve_var`.
- `docs/changelog.md` as the system of record (see the
  [changelog](changelog) itself and the `changelog/` Python package
  that generates blog posts from it).

#### Changed
- Writes to `local.oplog.rs` (insert / update / delete / findAndModify
  / drop / create / createIndexes) refuse with code 13 (Unauthorized).
- `$merge` validates `whenMatched` / `whenNotMatched` against the
  allowed string sets — typos surface as `AggregateError` instead of
  silently falling through to the default merge.

## [0.5.1b16] — 2026-05-16

### Sidebar grouping, auto-refreshing connections and cursors, Roles in the nav

The `/connections` and `/cursors` admin pages have always been live-data
views — they read `currentOp` and render the connection / cursor list
each time the page is requested — but they didn't refresh. The dashboard
polls 1 Hz over a WebSocket; these two felt stale next to it. v0.5.1b16
extracts each table's tbody into an HTMX partial and lets the tbody
itself swap every 5 s via `hx-trigger="every 5s"
hx-get="/connections/_rows"`. The page chrome and column headers stay
fixed; only the rows refresh. `/connections` also gains a (disabled)
Actions column with a tooltip explaining that connection-kill is
deferred until SecantusDB grows `killOp` — purely a layout-symmetry
fix so the page mirrors the shape of `/cursors`.

The sidebar gets two structural fixes. A `Roles` entry now lives
directly under `Users` with a sub-nav indent (it was reachable only via
the breadcrumb on `/users`, and `roles.html` was setting `active="users"`
so the wrong sidebar item highlighted while you were on the page). A
second visual separator above `Change stream` marks the boundary between
per-target data pages and operational-state pages, mirroring the
existing separator below `Server`.

A separate fix: 15 `*_via_mongosh` cross-driver smoke tests are now
grouped into a single xdist worker. Mongosh launches a full Node-based
shell, and under heavy parallel load the PBKDF2 work inside SCRAM-SHA-256
auth could blow past mongosh's connect timeout. Tagged with
`@pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="mongosh_smokes")` so they serialize.

#### Added
- Sidebar `Roles` entry under `Users` with sub-nav indent + correct
  active highlight on `/roles`.
- Sidebar visual separator above the operational-state group
  (`nav-ops-start` CSS class).
- `/connections` + `/cursors` auto-refresh tbody (`hx-trigger="every 5s"`)
  with new `_rows` partial endpoints.
- `/connections` disabled Actions column for layout symmetry with
  `/cursors`; tooltip explains `killOp` is deferred.

#### Fixed
- 15 `*_via_mongosh` cross-driver smoke tests serialized via
  `xdist_group="mongosh_smokes"` to dodge PBKDF2-handshake timeouts under
  parallel-test CPU contention.

## [0.5.1b15] — 2026-05-16

### One scaffold for every confirmation modal — escape, focus-trap, restored focus

The `secantus-admin` UI has nine confirmation / edit modals
(drop-database, drop-collection, drop-index, drop-user, change-password,
manage-roles, edit-document, delete-document, kill-cursor). They were
assembled at slightly different times and drifted in five different ways
— different destructive-button copy, different typed-confirm targets
(the delete-document modal asked the user to type the collection name
shared by every row; the kill-cursor modal asked for the giant int
cursor id), no Escape-to-close, no focus restoration to the trigger
element, no focus trap so Tab leaked back into the page behind, and
`aria-label="Close"` only on two of nine close buttons.

v0.5.1b15 consolidates all nine on a shared scaffold: a new
`modal-shell.js` exposes `openModal(url)` / `closeModal()` /
`setupModal(el)` plus a global htmx hook that captures the trigger
element so `closeModal()` can restore focus. Each modal partial has the
same overlay shape — `x-init="setupModal($el)"`,
`@click.self="closeModal()"`, `@keydown.escape.window="closeModal()"`,
`role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby` — and Tab / Shift+Tab
cycle within the modal's focusable children rather than escaping into
the page behind.

Three substantive fixes ride along with the scaffolding: destructive
button copy now always restates action+noun (Kill cursor / Delete
document / Drop index / Drop user / Drop database / Drop collection);
the delete-document typed-confirm asks for the doc's `_id` value rather
than the collection name; the kill-cursor typed-confirm asks for the
collection `ns` rather than the unguessable cursor id. None of these
change SecantusDB's wire-protocol behaviour.

#### Added
- `static/js/modal-shell.js`: `openModal(url)`, `closeModal()`,
  `setupModal(el)`, htmx hook for trigger-element capture.
- `[x-cloak]` CSS helper to prevent Alpine flash on first paint.

#### Changed
- All 9 confirmation / edit modal partials use the shared overlay
  shape with `role="dialog"` / `aria-modal` / `aria-labelledby`.
- Destructive button copy restates action+noun across the board.
- `delete-document` typed-confirm uses the doc's `_id` value (was the
  collection name).
- `kill-cursor` typed-confirm uses the collection `ns` (was the cursor
  id).

#### Fixed
- Escape now closes every modal.
- Focus restored to the triggering element after modal close.
- Tab focus-trap inside modals.
- `aria-label="Close"` on all 9 close buttons (was on 2).

## [0.5.1b14] — 2026-05-15

### Admin UI punch list — five silent-failure modes fixed

The May 2026 end-to-end review of the `secantus-admin` web UI catalogued
five P0s — bugs that didn't crash anything but presented wrong
information to the user. v0.5.1b14 fixes all five. None require any
database-level change; this is purely admin-UI plumbing, but each one
was either lying to the user or hiding a real error behind cheerful
copy.

The biggest was the **profiler page swallowing every exception** while
reading `system.profile`. A bare `except Exception:` rendered "no
entries yet — run an operation to see one appear here" no matter what
the underlying error was, including the target server being completely
unreachable. The clause is now narrowed to `PyMongoError` and the
friendly error message gets funnelled into the page's normal error
banner. The same page also had a **`flash` keyword argument that the
template never rendered** — every settings change returned `HX-Redirect`
and the user saw zero confirmation that anything had happened. The POST
handler now re-renders the page inline with a flash banner that names
the new level / slowms / sampleRate values.

The other three are dead-code cleanups: the **doc tour** in
`docs/admin.md` walked the user through a `/console` page that was
renamed to `/query` two refactors ago; the **Maintenance "Drop
collection" form** had an `hx-get` pointing at a route that never
existed; and the **dashboard router** still exposed a `GET
/_partials/dashboard-tiles` endpoint from before the WebSocket dashboard
landed.

#### Fixed
- Profiler page: narrowed bare `except Exception:` to `PyMongoError` so
  server-down errors surface (`routers/profiler.py`).
- Profiler page: added flash banner block to template + POST handler
  re-renders inline instead of `HX-Redirect`.
- Maintenance "Drop collection" form: dropped dead
  `hx-get="/maintenance/drop-collection-redirect"` attribute.
- Dashboard router: deleted unused
  `GET /_partials/dashboard-tiles` endpoint, partial template, and the
  two tests that exercised them.
- `docs/admin.md`: replaced stale `### Console` section with
  `### Query (/query)` + `### Insert (/insert)` + new `### Server
  (/server)` subsection.

## [0.5.1b13] — 2026-05-15

### Zero actionable failures — every driver gauge classified, every gap explained

Over the past few releases the cross-driver gauge pass rate has been
climbing — 99.5% at v0.5.1b4, 99.9% by last week's refresh. The last
0.1% was a handful of failures that either could not be fixed in
SecantusDB (a Java-driver SDAM cascade triggered by a server-side
`APIStrictError`), reproduced only under heavy parallel load (two
`mongo-go-driver` flakes), or assumed a multi-node replica-set
deployment SecantusDB deliberately doesn't simulate (Ruby's `w: 2`
write-concern test). Reporting them as plain "failures" overstated the
gap — but silently dropping them would let real regressions hide in the
same column.

v0.5.1b13 introduces **`validation_summary/expected_failures.py`** — a
small per-gauge registry of `(pattern, rationale)` entries. The
cross-driver summary now separates "Failed" (unexpected, a real bug we
need to fix) from "Expected" (a documented gap with a one-line reason
that ships in the report). A new **Adjusted** column reports the rate
excluding expected failures from the denominator — "how much of the
conformable surface actually conforms." Current numbers: **7,186 tests,
6,254 passed, 0 unexpected failures, 5 expected failures, 927 skipped —
100.0% adjusted across every driver.**

This release also bundles the gauge improvements that landed since
v0.5.1b4: `mapReduce` returns a graceful empty result for non-canonical
bodies, `$changeStream` against a standalone topology is rejected with
code `40573`, Node CSOT explain-plus-`timeoutMS` tests pass via a new
`block_connection` / `block_time_ms` failpoint pair, `getParameter`
advertises `authenticationMechanisms: ["SCRAM-SHA-256"]`, and
`createIndexes` / `create` reject unknown options up-front.

#### Added
- `validation_summary/expected_failures.py`: per-gauge registry of
  documented-known failures with rationales.
- Cross-driver summary "Expected" + "Adjusted pass rate" columns.
- `block_connection` / `block_time_ms` failpoint fields
  (`failpoints._FailCommand`).

#### Changed
- `mapReduce` returns a graceful empty result for non-canonical
  map/reduce bodies (wire-shape probes pass).
- `$changeStream` on a standalone topology is rejected with code 40573.
- `getParameter` advertises `authenticationMechanisms: ["SCRAM-SHA-256"]`.
- `createIndexes` rejects unknown per-index options
  (`_INDEX_SPEC_KNOWN_OPTIONS` whitelist).
- `create` rejects unknown collection options
  (`_CREATE_KNOWN_OPTIONS` whitelist).
- `validate-all` serialized (`max_workers=1`) to dodge load-induced
  inter-gauge flakes.

## [0.5.1b4] — 2026-05-12

### Cross-driver conformance summary — 99.5% across 7,186 tests on one page

Until this release, comparing SecantusDB's conformance across the five
driver gauges (pymongo / mongo-java-driver / mongo-go-driver /
mongo-node-driver / mongo-ruby-driver) required opening five different
reports and squinting at five different per-category breakdowns whose
denominators came from incompatible units of count — JUnit `<testcase>`
versus Mocha test versus RSpec example versus `go test` event versus
pytest item.

v0.5.1b4 ships **`docs/validation-summary.md`** — a single table that
normalises on test count, one row per gauge, the same five columns
across the board: tests run, passed, failed, skipped, pass rate. A new
`validation_summary` Python module reads each gauge's raw artifact
under `.validation/` directly and renders the table; a new
`invoke validate-summary` task refreshes it.

Current numbers: **7,186 tests, 6,232 passed, 33 failed, 921 skipped —
99.5% pass rate** across all five drivers. Java is biggest by raw count
(4,710 tests, 4,242 passed); Node smallest (364).

This release also rolls up two driver-gauge fixes that landed since
v0.5.1b1: a Java widening to 21 of 112 driver-sync functional classes
(+34 passes), and a snapshot-read-concern rejection that turned three
`SessionsTest` snapshot-error scenarios from "expected error, got
success" into "expected error, got `SnapshotUnavailable` (code 246)".

#### Added
- `docs/validation-summary.md` cross-driver normalized table.
- `validation_summary/` Python module (raw-artifact reader + renderer).
- `invoke validate-summary` task.
- `snapshot` readConcern rejected with code 246
  (`SnapshotUnavailable`).
- Java gauge: `ChangeStreamsTest`, `UnifiedWriteConcernTest`,
  `VersionedApiTest` unified-spec runners (21 of 112 driver-sync
  functional classes total).

#### Fixed
- RTD build for v0.5.1b3 failed on a missing toctree entry for the new
  summary file; b4 is the first release where the docs match what's on
  PyPI.

## [0.5.1b1] — 2026-05-12

### Java gauge scope made honest — 18 of 112 driver-sync classes, five named follow-ups

The Java gauge passing rate had been reported at "100%" — but only
across the 13 driver-sync functional classes the gauge was running.
v0.5.1b1 widens the include set to 18 of 112 and adds an explicit
**Scope** section to `docs/validation-report-java.md` that surfaces the
"X of 112 driver-sync functional classes" denominator so the headline
number isn't misleading.

The widened set surfaced five real failures, all named and tracked in
`tasks/backlog.md` §5: Java apiStrict pool-clear cascade, mapReduce
non-canonical bodies, snapshot reads on standalone, distinct
apiStrict — none are SecantusDB bugs, but they're now documented
expected-fail entries.

#### Added
- Java gauge include set widened to 18 of 112 driver-sync functional
  classes (`java_validation/include_modules.py` waves 1 + 2).
- "Scope" section in Java validation report exposing the include-set
  denominator (`java_validation/generate_report.py`).

## [0.5.0b18] — 2026-05-12

### Ruby gauge climbs to 99%, completing the cross-driver 99–100% band

The Ruby gauge had been the weakest of the five at ~95% — a handful of
real SecantusDB gaps the Ruby driver exercises but the others don't.
v0.5.0b18 closes the high-value ones: `writeConcernError` is now
attached on `w > 1` (CannotSatisfyWriteConcern code 100), invalid
`wildcardProjection` is rejected on `createIndexes`, `commitQuorum` is
validated at the top level, `listIndexes` rejects negative batchSize
(code 51024), and `$collStats` surfaces capped-collection bounds
(`storageStats.{capped, max, maxSize}`).

Net: Ruby gauge from 94.6% → 99.7%, 13 net passes. All five driver
gauges now sit in the 99–100% band.

#### Added
- `writeConcernError` attached on `w > 1` (`CannotSatisfyWriteConcern`
  code 100).
- `createIndexes` validates `wildcardProjection` shape.
- `commitQuorum` validated at top-level.
- `$collStats` surfaces capped bounds (`storageStats.{capped, max,
  maxSize}`).

#### Changed
- `listIndexes` rejects negative `batchSize` with code 51024.
