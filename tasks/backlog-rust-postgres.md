# Backlog: the Rust PostgreSQL server

A living list of where this server does not yet behave like the real
product it stands in for: stubs, stopgaps, deferred work and known bugs.
Update it when you stub something, defer a slice, or find a limitation, and
delete an item's lines when you fix it -- finished work lives in git
history and `changelog.d/`, not here. Don't add work that already has a fix
in flight; that lives on its branch and PR.

The backlog is four files, one per server:

| file | server |
| --- | --- |
| `tasks/backlog-rust-mongodb.md` | the Rust MongoDB server, and the Rust storage both Rust servers use; also CI, build and release items no one server owns |
| `tasks/backlog-rust-postgres.md` | the Rust PostgreSQL server |
| `tasks/backlog-python-mongodb.md` | the Python MongoDB server (and the admin UI) |
| `tasks/backlog-python-postgres.md` | the Python PostgreSQL / SQL server |

An item about more than one server is in each file it concerns. Section
numbers (`7.077`, `3.1`, ...) are the ones the single `tasks/backlog.md`
used, kept so the code comments that cite them still resolve.

**`- [ ]` is open work, and every item here is open.** An open item's bold
headline must not read as finished: if completed context belongs in it,
lead with `**OPEN —` (`tests/test_backlog_markers.py`).

**Every item carries `Backlog-ID:` and `Verify:` lines.** `Verify:` names a
gap test under `tests/backlog/` that asserts the real product's answer and so
fails while the item is open, or says why none can (`none -- ...`).
`python tools/backlog.py verify` runs them all; the `backlog` skill
(`.claude/skills/backlog/SKILL.md`) is the protocol for filing, working and
closing an item.

**Reproduce an item before working it** -- a probe, the failing test, the
query -- and size it from that, not from the text. Entries here have
described work as missing that was done, and understated bugs by naming one
symptom of several. Correct a superseded entry rather than adding a newer
one beside it.

## Open from the 2026-08-26 triage

- **Scope decision — psycopg's `test_generators.py::test_cancel` and the
  `proxy`-marked `test_cancel_safe_error` / `test_cancel_safe_timeout` fail on
  macOS in the CLIENT.** macOS libpq sends the cancel on a not-yet-connected
  non-blocking socket and waits forever; native PostgreSQL 15 fails the same
  call sequence (7 of 10 rounds), and `pproxy` cannot start under this
  venv's uvloop on Python 3.12. `psycopg_validation/include_paths.py` keeps
  them out of the macOS gauge. Nothing to do server-side.
- **Scope decision — a `LANGUAGE internal` wrapper over a C function with no
  SQL form** (an I/O function such as `int4out`, an aggregate transition
  function) is a catalog row that answers 42883 when called. PostgreSQL calls
  the C symbol with whatever the declaration says, so a wrapper over the
  wrong signature returns garbage or crashes the backend: there is no defined
  behaviour to imitate. Wrappers over C functions that have a SQL form work.
- **Scope decision — dotted / `$`-named columns.** Their answers match
  PostgreSQL, but a predicate over such a column runs per row and a plain
  CREATE INDEX on one builds a path index no query uses. The shared storage
  reads a dot as a path separator and a leading `$` as an operator in every
  filter and index key spec (MQL semantics the Rust MongoDB server depends
  on), so an index-backed read needs a literal-key index path in
  `secantus-storage` or a stored-name escape, the second an on-disk format
  change both PG servers share. Not justified by a name SQLAlchemy's suite
  uses only to prove quoting works.
- **Scope decision — pgjdbc `BlobTransactionTest`** needs `CREATE FUNCTION
  lo_manage() ... LANGUAGE C` (the `lo` contrib trigger). `LANGUAGE C` loads
  a shared library into the server process, which a server written in Rust
  has no ABI to host; the `lo` contrib module is not shipped.
- **Scope decision — direct writes to a catalog** (an UPDATE that changes a
  catalog row, a DELETE that matches one, an INSERT into a catalog) are
  0A000: the catalogs are computed from the store, so there is no row to
  change. An UPDATE leaving rows as they are reports them, as pgjdbc's
  updatable-result-set write-back needs.
- **Not the server — pgjdbc `ConnectionTest::pGStreamSettings`** asserts the
  CLIENT socket's receive buffer and flickers on its own.
- **Scope decision — the sqllogictest gauge on the Rust server**
  (`SECANTUS_GAUGE_SERVER=rust`, report `slt-raw-rust-server.json`): the lines
  it still reports are SQLite expectations PostgreSQL 15 also fails (`IN ()`
  is a syntax error; DELETE through a simple view succeeds;
  `col / CAST(32 AS REAL)` is a real; `415.0000000000000000` for numeric; an
  ungrouped column under COALESCE is 42803). The Python lane marks the same
  ones as expected divergences.
- **Scope decision — EXPLAIN** prints PostgreSQL's plan SHAPE with zero
  costs, and which side of a hash join is built follows this server's join
  order. Costs and join sides are PostgreSQL's cost model (statistics, page
  counts), which this server does not have. A PARTIAL expression index is not
  used for a WHERE comparing the expression with a constant (its field is
  absent outside the predicate) -- a plan choice; the WHERE still runs, as a
  scan.
- **Scope decision — planning-time constant-folding errors.** PostgreSQL
  raises `select 1/0 from (values (1)) v(a) where false` and `select f(0)
  from t where false` because `eval_const_expressions` folds every immutable
  subexpression over constants while planning, whether or not a row reaches
  it; here each answers zero rows. PostgreSQL's manual (4.2.14) calls this a
  quirk applications must not rely on, and folding anything PostgreSQL does
  not would raise errors it does not -- worse than zero rows. No answer a
  query returns differs.
- **Known residual — PL/pgSQL `SQL expression` CONTEXT frame**
  (`tools/probes/plpgsql_expr_context.py`, 58 of 60 shapes match PostgreSQL
  15.19): `(array[1,2])[1]/0` (libpg_query deparses the subexpression without
  its parentheses, so it cannot be run alone) and `immutable_sql_fn()/0`
  (PostgreSQL inlines an IMMUTABLE SQL function before folding; a user
  function is not folded here).
- **Scope decision — foreign data**: no FDW handler exists, so a foreign
  table refuses reads and writes with PostgreSQL's own `55000` for a
  handler-less wrapper; `postgres_fdw` / `file_fdw` are contrib modules this
  server does not ship.
- [ ] **RUST pgserver: 10 of PostgreSQL 15.19's 907 ICU collations are
  refused.** `pg_collation` lists the other 897 (`pg_icu_collations.tsv`),
  each checked to ORDER BY as PostgreSQL does over a 278-string probe across
  25 scripts (2026-10-16). Left out, each 42704:
  - `mr`, `as` and `kok` (with `kok-Deva` and `kok-Latn`) and their
    regional forms: ICU4X's collator does not apply their conjunct rule
    (`&ह<क्ष`, `ক্ষ` likewise) -- not with its compiled data, and not with
    data generated from ICU's own release (measured 2026-10-16, both
    `compare` and the sort key). The fix is in ICU4X, or a rule applied
    here on top of it.
  - `en-US-u-va-posix`: ICU4X does not select the POSIX variant from the
    `-u-va-posix` keyword.
  Related, not tested: none of PostgreSQL's libc collations beyond `C` /
  `POSIX` exists here (`COLLATE "en_US"` is 42704), and which ones a server
  has is the host's locale list.
  Backlog-ID: RP-005
  Verify: tests/backlog/test_rp_triage.py::test_marathi_icu_collation_orders_as_postgres
- **Scope decision — the comparison functions whose magnitude is the
  platform's answer the SIGN only** (Joe, 2026-10-16): `bttextcmp`,
  `bpcharcmp` and `jsonb_cmp` compare under the database collation through
  `strcoll` (`bttextcmp('b', 'a')` is 14 on the macOS reference), and
  `tsvector_cmp` / `tsquery_cmp` by their storage layouts; each answers
  -1 / 0 / 1 in PostgreSQL's order, which is all PostgreSQL promises.
- **Scope decision — pgcrypto Blowfish and CAST5** PGP messages are verified
  against GnuPG, because both reference servers' OpenSSL 3 builds refuse
  those ciphers. Do not "fix" them to agree with a PG error.
- **Scope decision — constraint `oid`s** are this server's own numbers. An
  oid is an allocation counter (PostgreSQL's differ between two clusters
  given the same DDL); only consistency across the catalogs matters, which
  the corpora check through `conrelid` / `conindid` joins.
- **Scope decision — jsonb equality and UNIQUE do not use an index.** jsonb
  compares by value (`json::jsonb_value_key`), so an equality on a jsonb
  column no longer uses a btree index on it, and a jsonb UNIQUE constraint
  reads the table per write statement. A lookup over the stored text cannot
  be made sound (one value has unboundedly many spellings: `1`, `1.0`,
  `1e0`), and a value-keyed index is an on-disk format change for both PG
  servers. The costs stay as they are, correct.
- **Scope decision — REPEATABLE READ answers 40001 after a wait when ANY
  transaction committed since its snapshot**, where PostgreSQL goes on unless
  the ROW changed. WiredTiger cannot continue a transaction after a conflict,
  so going on means a new snapshot, which under REPEATABLE READ is invisible
  only when nothing it could read later committed -- unknowable for the rest
  of the transaction. Narrowing to the conflicting table would let a later
  read see rows committed after the snapshot: a wrong answer, worse than a
  40001 every client must retry anyway.

## 3. Deferred work (skipped from a slice, ready to come back)

- **CLOSED (scope record, batch 68, 2026-10-07) — RUST pgserver:
      reading ONE ROW BY PRIMARY KEY, the per-statement gap to PostgreSQL.**
      Release build against PostgreSQL 15.19, libpq `PQexecPrepared`: PK read
      ~41-43 us against PostgreSQL's 25.4; extended `select 1` 32.0-33.1
      against 21.4-22.1; simple `select 1` 27.9-28.8 against 22.7-23.0. The
      gap is CPU on the connection's thread, spread over many pieces none
      above ~1.4 us (the two socket syscalls PostgreSQL also makes, the
      storage read, Describe, the extended group's open / commit,
      `install_user_types`, malloc / free). No single lever is left; closing
      the gap would mean restructuring the statement path (PostgreSQL runs a
      cached plan in a process-per-connection backend with no hand-offs),
      not fixing a hot spot. Two things already tried and rejected, so they
      are not re-tried: skipping the per-statement transaction group for
      statements that touch no storage (moves `select 1` by ~3 us, leaves
      every real query where it was, and risks statement-level snapshot
      consistency), and a per-session WiredTiger cursor cache (cursor opens
      3 -> 2 per row read, no measurable change).

- [ ] **OPEN — `test_connect_error_multi_hosts_each_message_preserved` failed
      twice in a full psycopg-gauge run; cause UNKNOWN, and socket exhaustion
      is now RULED OUT (measured 2026-09-19).** The test connects to two RFC
      5737 reserved addresses and requires both attempts to fail with
      `connection timeout expired`. It never touches this server. It runs in
      the gauge (re-enabled by PR #1484; standalone it connects 6/6 in 4.04s
      with the expected error). The unexplained part is that two runs failed
      it in **0.04s** — an immediate `connect()` error rather than a timeout.

      Ruled out by measurement during a full gauge run: ephemeral-port
      exhaustion (peak 1,155 of 16,384, sawtoothing, no leak) and descriptor
      exhaustion (`ulimit -n` 1,048,576; weaker evidence, the fd sample
      followed the runner rather than its pytest child).
      **If it recurs, capture the exception text and errno before theorising** —
      that names the failure and distinguishes the remaining possibilities.
      Backlog-ID: RP-006
      Verify: none -- client-side psycopg test flake connecting to reserved addresses; never touches the server

- [ ] **OPEN — Rust PostgreSQL server on LINUX: durable writes are
      1.2-1.4x slower than PostgreSQL at eight clients and reads ~1.1x
      (0.1.0-beta.15, 2026-10-13); one client's statement costs ~3x
      PostgreSQL's CPU.** Different from the macOS entry below: on Linux the
      cost of one statement is the problem, not concurrency.

      **Current state** (DigitalOcean `c-16`, Xeon 8280, ~12,200 `fdatasync`
      a second, PostgreSQL 16 defaults, neither server over TLS, seven
      trials, eight clients, PostgreSQL / 0.1.0-beta.15): insert 20,106 /
      15,866 (1.27x); insert into a shared table 20,753 / 16,703 (1.24x);
      update 22,843 / 16,655 (1.37x); select 54,395 / 48,849 (1.11x). A rate
      is comparable only within one run. The site publishes the 8-client
      rows only (Joe's call, 2026-10-12); with clients on separate droplets
      the 1- and 4-client rows are steady (2% to 9% spread on this server)
      and publishing them is Joe's call.

      **How to measure.** `invoke do-pg-bench` (clients on the two client
      droplets over the private network by default; `sslmode=disable` in
      every DSN, checked against `pg_stat_ssl`). A `c-16` is not one
      machine: each run records the processor and `pg_test_fsync`'s rate in
      `facts.txt`; compare two runs only when those agree. `do-pg-bench`
      refuses a server disk under 5,000 `fdatasync` calls a second, and
      `invoke do-pg-up` replaces droplets until one passes. Over loopback,
      1- and 4-client rows move with CPU placement (this server loses 15% to
      25% unpinned, PostgreSQL 2% to 6%) and with the disk's own sync-rate
      spread (~13%); `pg_concurrency.py` has no pinning option.

      **The single-connection cost** (2026-10-13, data in
      `bench/results/pg-droplet/2026-10-13-single-connection-cost/`): no
      thread hand-off (one server thread wakes once a statement); it is CPU
      on that thread, 61 us a statement against PostgreSQL's 22 — ~97,000
      user-mode instructions to 35,000, at 0.54 IPC to 0.91, with 684 branch
      mispredictions to 89 and 2.4x the instruction-cache misses. The
      symbolised profile is flat (nothing above 3%, the allocator first).
      The release build already has fat LTO, one codegen unit and a profile
      (`scripts/build_pg_release.sh`); the placement sensitivity follows from
      the longer run per statement.

      **Three slow update trials, never seen again, cause unknown.** In the
      0.1.0-beta.13 run of 2026-10-13, eight clients updating by primary key
      gave 12,418 and 12,209 a second and then 8,019, 8,156 and 9,000, one
      server process throughout. Fifty-four further trials on three droplets
      had none (`bench/results/pg-droplet/2026-10-13-slow-update-trials/`).
      The benchmark now records the disk's flush time and the server's CPU a
      statement for every trial and prints an unsteady row trial by trial,
      so the next one says which it was.

      **What is left on the prepared write path, in order of what the
      profile offers:**
      - a stored value into any other column type (`varchar(n)`, `smallint`,
        `numeric`, `timestamptz`, `bool`...) is still planned per Execute,
        because the planner checks or converts it. Templating those means
        running the column's check at substitution time;
      - a parameter of a kind with no stand-in (bool, date, numeric, bytes,
        NULL) is never templated at all;
      - once any table in the database has row-level security, nothing is
        templated;
      - `execute_statement` outside `update_matching` (~20% of an UPDATE);
      - an int bound for a `float8` or `numeric` column is still planned
        per Execute (only int32 -> `bigint` is carried).

      **What is left on the unprepared statement** (measured on the
      development Mac only, NOT re-measured on Linux; `bench/
      pg_statement_cost.py`'s `select_row_var` stage):
      - a statement whose shape is not templated still pays one parse,
        and 70% of a parse is libpg_query packing its tree to protobuf
        (`protobuf_c_message_pack` walks all ~270 alternatives of the
        `Node` oneof for every node, twice). Not ours to change, and
        `pg_query` 6.2 has no parse that skips it;
      - a decimal or exponent literal, a negative number written against
        its operator (`k =-5`), a string with a backslash or an `E''`
        prefix: not taken out by `plan_cache::literal_family`, planned
        every time;
      - the plan cache is per connection and holds 256 entries, cleared
        whole when full.
      Backlog-ID: RP-007
      Verify: none -- Linux throughput/CPU-per-statement benchmark campaign

- **ACCEPTED AS A LIMIT 2026-10-07 (Joe), and may be revisited — Rust
      PostgreSQL server on macOS: a READ statement costs ~1.45-1.6x
      PostgreSQL's, and durable writes reach ~3x scaling at 8 clients against
      PostgreSQL's ~4x (batch 72).** Not being worked: no lever above ~1us is
      known for reads, and the write gap is the hand-off between one group's
      log write and the next (the disk is ~55% busy at N=8). Joe kept the
      option to reopen it; a session that does should re-measure batch 72's
      numbers first (`bench/pg_concurrency.py`, `bench/pg_statement_cost.py`
      against a release `secantusd-pg`, `SECANTUSD_PG` set from a worktree,
      no other suite running). Constraints that shape any reopening:
      - **Group commit that acknowledges before the flush was tried and
        DROPPED** (Joe: match PostgreSQL visibility) — it made a row visible
        to other sessions before its flush. WiredTiger prepared transactions
        are refused on logged tables, so they are no way round it.
        `test_concurrent_acknowledged_commits_survive_a_kill_in_durable_mode`
        is the guard.
      - **Do NOT "lift the global lock" as a concurrency fix** — it guards
        DDL and admin paths, not row writes, and protects the oplog's
        strictly-monotonic `seq` / event order and the durable-close /
        checkpoint path.

### 3.1 Authentication

- [ ] **RUST PG server: what the login rules leave.** TLS, SCRAM channel
  binding, client certificates, `--tls-require`, `pg_stat_ssl`,
  refusing unknown users (the default; `--trust-unknown-users` opts out),
  `--hba-file`, revocation lists, user name maps,
  `--tls-client-name DN` and reload are in (`crates/secantus-pg/src/tls.rs`,
  `scram_binding.rs`, `hba.rs`, `crl.rs`, `ident.rs`, `live.rs`). The three
  login comparisons against PostgreSQL 15 (`tools/probes/pg_login_options.py`,
  `pg_login_tls_files.py`, `pg_login_hba.py`) run in
  `tests/test_rust_pg_login_differential.py` (CI's `pg-oracle` lane; locally
  only with `SECANTUS_PG15_BIN` set). Open:
  - **Without a `pg_hba.conf` a role with no password is trusted** (with
    one, a `scram-sha-256` line refuses it). A user there is no role for is
    refused, as on PostgreSQL, unless `--trust-unknown-users` is given.
  - **With `--hba-file`:**
    - **Refused at startup, by line number**: the methods that need an
      outside service (`peer`, `ident`, `gss`, `sspi`, `ldap`, `radius`,
      `pam`, `bsd`) and `include` directives (PostgreSQL 16's).
    - **A `map=` on a method other than `cert` is refused**; PostgreSQL
      takes it for `ident`, `peer`, `gss` and `sspi` too, none of which is
      read here.
  - **TLS files:**
    - **A revocation list's issuing distribution point named relative to
      its issuer is refused at startup** (`crl.rs`); one with a full name,
      a delta list and a reasons-only or indirect list answer as
      PostgreSQL 15.19 does.
    - **A self-signed root is never checked against the revocation lists**,
      as OpenSSL 3.6 has it (`check_cert_crl` skips it). PostgreSQL linked
      against an older OpenSSL (3.0.13 on Ubuntu 24.04) checks the root as
      well, so a list scoped to user certificates or to a distribution point,
      issued by the root, refuses every chain there and none here. The login
      probe issues its scoped lists from an intermediate, where the two
      versions agree.
    - **A user name map's patterns are read as the SQL `~` operator reads
      them** (the `regex` crate, through `pg_regex_source`'s POSIX-class
      translation, 2026-10-15), so they share that engine's distance from
      PostgreSQL's advanced regular expressions.
  - **The libpq scenarios (`attempt`) in the login probes do not retry**
    when the answer is the close; `raw_first` does (up to four times), after
    `pg_login_tls_files.py` once failed 479 of 480 in CI when the client
    read PostgreSQL's close before its `unknown ca` alert. None of the libpq
    scenarios has shown the race.
  - **The TLS gauge run sets `PGSSLMODE` for libpq, so a test that names
    its own `sslmode` is not moved onto TLS by it**; and a test that fails
    in BOTH the plain and TLS runs is printed and does not fail the
    `psycopg-tls.yml` lane, which is the plain gauge's number and has no
    Linux lane that gates it.
  Backlog-ID: RP-013
  Verify: none -- what is left needs an outside service (peer, ident, gss, sspi, ldap, radius, pam, bsd), or is the regex engine, a relative-name distribution point, or probe tooling; the login comparison (tests/test_rust_pg_login_differential.py) pins the rest

## 5. Known bugs and edge cases to watch

- [ ] **RUST pgserver: the planner's choices that decide row order are only
  partly modelled.** **Decided (Joe, 2026-10-16): build a cost model** --
  enough of PostgreSQL's planner to make its choices, since the order rows
  come out in (and ties under ORDER BY) is the order of the plan it picks.
  Built so far (`secantus-pgplan/src/hashagg.rs`, 2026-10-16): a GROUP BY
  of bare columns over one table, with no WHERE and no grouping sets, comes
  out in PostgreSQL's HashAggregate order -- its estimate of the groups over
  a table with no statistics (`estimate_rel_size`'s 10-page minimum,
  `estimate_num_groups`' defaults), its tuple hash, and simplehash's
  placement and iteration -- and an ORDER BY over it sorts with
  PostgreSQL's quicksort. So does a `SELECT DISTINCT` of bare columns
  (a HashAggregate over the select list), and both under a WHERE, whose
  rows and groups are estimated with the planner's default selectivities
  (`filter_selectivity`: equality, `<>`, ranges, `IN`, AND, OR). And the
  choice between that HashAggregate and a Sort + Group (or a Unique) is
  PostgreSQL's (`secantus-pgplan/src/costsize.rs`, 2026-10-16): the
  cheapest scan priced as a sequential, bitmap heap or index scan (the
  heap's real pages, `btcostestimate`, Mackert-Lohman), `cost_sort`,
  `cost_group`, `cost_agg`, and `add_path`'s 1% fuzz, under which the
  sorted path's order wins a tie; a GROUP BY holding the whole primary key
  groups by it alone; an ORDER BY over the group keys moves them first;
  an aggregate with DISTINCT or its own ORDER BY is never hashed; and
  under a LIMIT with no ORDER BY a Group over an index scan in the keys'
  order is weighed too, by the cost of the first rows the LIMIT takes.
  186 of 186 shapes match 15.19 at 40, 300 and 3,000 rows. A table
  ANALYZE measured is modelled too (2026-10-16): ANALYZE records each
  column's `pg_statistic` row as `compute_scalar_stats` computes it from a
  sample of the whole table (`stanullfrac`, `stadistinct`, `stawidth`;
  `hashagg::analyze_column`) and `relpages` / `reltuples`, as a snapshot,
  and the group estimate reads them (`get_variable_numdistinct`); the
  hash table's growth is simplehash's (an integer threshold, checked on
  every row's lookup). 212 of 212 shapes over analysed int, text, bool,
  float8, char(n), varchar and NULL-bearing columns match 15.19 at 20 to
  10,000 rows, and again with half as many rows, and four times as many,
  inserted after the ANALYZE. A WHERE over an analysed table is
  estimated too (2026-10-16, `secantus-pgplan/src/colstats.rs`): ANALYZE
  keeps each column's most common values, histogram and correlation as
  `compute_scalar_stats` builds them, and a WHERE of comparisons with
  constants (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, AND) gets `var_eq_const`'s
  and `scalarineqsel`'s selectivities (the MCV and histogram split, the
  histogram's ends read from an index as `get_actual_variable_range`
  does, `clauselist_selectivity`'s range pairs); an index scan's cost
  reads the column's correlation (`cost_index`), a Group over an index
  scan in the keys' order is weighed with or without a LIMIT, and the
  groups reach the hash table in the heap's order. 120 of 120 such shapes
  match 15.19 at 20 to 10,000 rows, 168 of 168 and 84 of 84 with rows
  inserted after the ANALYZE. So do `IN` lists (`scalararraysel`), `OR`s
  (`clauselist_selectivity_or`, with a BitmapOr path priced where each
  arm's index quals are on one column leading one index:
  `cost_bitmap_or_node`), `IS [NOT] NULL` (`nulltestsel`) and a measured
  WHERE under a LIMIT, and a non-unique integer index whose duplicates
  deduplication merges onto one leaf is sized so (`_bt_dedup_pass`):
  144 of 144 such shapes, 72 of 72 with rows inserted after the ANALYZE,
  and 28 of 28 deduplicated-index shapes at 300 to 3,000 rows. Not
  yet:
  - An `OR` in the WHERE (a BitmapOr path), which keeps the HashAggregate
    unpriced (and is declined under a LIMIT); a DISTINCT with an ORDER BY,
    whose sort is not weighed; an ORDER BY with a LIMIT.
  - A WHERE with a pattern, `IS NULL` or an expression (declined).
  - GROUP BY an expression, over a join or a subquery, and past about
    50,000 estimated groups, where the HashAggregate's spilling is priced.
  - A table whose rows are not text, bytea or fixed width (numeric, arrays,
    json): its heap pages are taken at the estimated density.
  - DISTINCT ON, and a citext DISTINCT, which PostgreSQL sorts.
  - The heap's order after UPDATE or DELETE (rows the hash table reads in
    another order). The size CREATE INDEX records and what ANALYZE
    stores are modelled (`__sql_relstats__`), but not REINDEX's,
    CLUSTER's or an ALTER TABLE that builds an index, nor across RENAME.
    Declined over an analysed table, keeping the old order: a range over
    a column that is not an integer (a text histogram is in the
    reference's locale: `select g from t3 where t > 'x2' group by g`), or
    equality on a text column whose repeated values overflow the MCV
    list; `NOT IN`; an `IN` list of nine or more (a hashed
    ScalarArrayOpExpr, costed otherwise) or with a repeated value; an
    `OR` nested in an `OR`, or whose arms share a clause or repeat
    (`find_duplicate_ors`); a BitmapOr arm whose index quals span two
    columns (a BitmapAnd: `select t from ti where (g = 1 and k < 100) or
    k > 9000 group by t`) or a column that several indexes hold; a null
    test on an indexed column (an index qual); a plain index scan whose
    index order is not the heap's; a
    join on its columns (`eqjoinsel` over its most common
    values); a key of a type whose statistics are not modelled (dates,
    numeric, arrays); extended statistics (`CREATE STATISTICS`); a table
    of more rows than ANALYZE samples (30,000), whose sample is random.
    A deduplicated non-unique index past one leaf keeps
    `btree_size`'s undeduplicated estimate, as without statistics.
    VACUUM (`relallvisible`, the visibility map) is declined entirely;
    it cannot run in a transaction block, so it was not measured. A
    ROLLBACK undoes ANALYZE's `relpages` / `reltuples` here, which
    PostgreSQL writes in place.
  - Joins: the join method (`secantus-pgplan/src/joincost.rs`: hash and
    merge joins priced as PostgreSQL does) decides whether a cursor over
    `a [LEFT] JOIN b ON a.x = b.y ORDER BY a.x` scrolls (at a cursor's
    tenth of the rows; 96 of 96 shapes match 15.19; this was RP-043), and
    the order a join of two tables on one equality emits its rows: a
    merge join's sides in key order, ties as each side's quicksort leaves
    them; a hash join's matches in its bucket's order (33 of 33). Under a
    WHERE each side is filtered by its own conjuncts before it is put in
    order, the plan is priced with them (either side outer, `add_path`'s
    startup costs, and under a LIMIT the fractional cost, where a nested
    loop over a materialised inner usually wins), and a WHERE no
    NULL-extended row passes makes a LEFT join inner (159 of 159 shapes
    at 20, 300 and 3,000 rows). A join on one expression equality
    (`on a.x = b.y + 3`, either side or both) is sorted or hashed by each
    side's value, priced with no statistics for the expression and its
    operators in the clause's cost; a LIMIT straight over a general join
    is priced for its rows (57 of 57). The ON's and WHERE's equalities
    form PostgreSQL's equivalence classes: one with a constant filters
    every member's side by it and leaves an inner join no join clause (a
    nested loop over every pair; a LEFT join's outer constant filters the
    inner side and its ON then selects every pair), one without filters
    each side by the equalities among its own members and joins on its
    first member each side (102 of 102). A chain of three stored tables
    on two column equalities, inner or LEFT, is planned by PostgreSQL's
    join order search (`secantus-pg/src/join_search.rs`): each pair a
    clause joins, then each with the third, in one `add_path` list, in the
    orders the outer joins allow; a LEFT join's hash right join returns
    the rows nothing matched in its hash table's order, two tables or
    three. An inner chain whose clauses share a key is one equivalence
    class over the three tables: every pair joins on its derived clause,
    and a merge join reads a pair already merged on the class unsorted,
    materialised (integer keys only). 83 of 86 shapes at 20, 300 and
    3,000 rows; the three left are a merge right join. A chain of four
    stored tables joined INNER, each on one column equality to a table
    before it with no column in two clauses, runs the same search over
    four relations (`secantus-pg/src/join_order.rs`), bushy pairs
    included (32 of 32 shapes at 20, 300 and 3,000 rows). Not yet: two
    classes spanning both sides (two join keys); an expression in a
    class; a LEFT join's class through the general path; a class over
    three tables of text or other non-integer keys; three tables with a
    WHERE over two of them, a LIMIT, or a merge right join; four tables
    with a LEFT join, a key two clauses share, a WHERE over two of them
    or a LIMIT; more than four tables; an expression key with a function
    call or a cast that costs; parameterized nested loops (an index scan inner); a LIMIT with
    an ORDER BY, or with a WHERE over the general path; a join of more
    than 200,000 rows a side, which streams in scan order.
  - Sorts that spill to disk runs are not PostgreSQL's merge.

- [ ] **OPEN — RUST pgserver on LINUX: psycopg's timing tests fail in CI
      and pass on macOS (first measured 2026-10-12).** No Linux lane ran
      psycopg's suite against the Rust PostgreSQL server until
      `.github/workflows/psycopg-tls.yml`. Its first two runs, on
      `ubuntu-latest`, 5,788 tests each (80 skipped, 34 xfailed, 3
      xpassed, 1 deselected); the same tree on macOS has no failure:

      | run | in the clear | over TLS |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | 1 | 6 fail, 1,689 s | cut off at 98% by the runner's 1,800 s backstop |
      | 2 | 31 fail, 2,492 s | 14 fail, 2,067 s |

      - **The NOTIFY timing tests fail in every run, in either
        transport**: `test_notify.py::test_notify` and
        `::test_notify_timeout`, their `test_notify_async.py` twins, and
        in run 2 the four `test_notify_query_notify` cases. Each sends a
        NOTIFY 0.25 s after it starts, from a second connection it opens
        then, and asserts when it arrives: 0.306 to 0.328 s measured,
        where 0.25 +/- 0.025 or 0.05 is allowed. So 55 to 80 ms late.
        Not diagnosed. The server wakes an idle listener by a
        `tokio::sync::Notify` and sets `TCP_NODELAY`, so nothing polls;
        what is left is the time a debug build takes to accept the second
        connection and run the NOTIFY on a shared runner. Measure that on
        a quiet Linux box, and with a release build, before calling it
        the runner.
      - `test_concurrency.py::test_notifies` is the same measurement and
        fails in some runs and not others.
      - **`test_cursor_async.py::test_leak` failed 22 of its 72 cases in
        run 2 in the clear, and none in run 1 or over TLS.** It counts
        Python objects in the client; it also failed twice on macOS on a
        loaded machine and passed three times alone.
      - `test_concurrency_async.py::test_type_error_shadow` hit the 20 s
        per-test timeout in all three completed runs.

      - Later runs each failed something else once: 3 and 5, then 10 and
        10 (PR #1905), where
        `test_concurrency_async.py::test_eintr[ITIMER_REAL-SIGALRM]` failed
        over TLS only. Its client script was killed by its own interval
        timer, which fires every 0.25 s and can land while the interpreter
        is shutting down; nothing the server answered.

      What the lane gates, given that: a run that stopped short, and a
      test that fails over TLS, passes in the clear, **and fails over TLS
      again when run again by itself**. `::test_notify*`,
      `::test_notifies` and `::test_leak` are left out of that by name
      (`SHARED_RUNNER_NOISE` in `psycopg_validation/check_run.py`, applied
      only with `--shared-runner`), because they fail in most runs in
      either transport. **So a change that delays NOTIFY over TLS only
      would not fail that lane**, and neither would a TLS fault that shows
      once in two tries; `./inv validate-psycopg-rust --tls` on a
      developer's machine holds every test to one run. Nothing gates the
      plain number on Linux.

- [ ] **OPEN — a backend-cancel test asserts a fixed 1 s bound on a shared
      runner.** `tests/test_rust_pgserver_slice.py::test_pg_cancel_and_terminate_backend_signal_a_running_statement`
      asserts `time.monotonic() - t0 < 1.0` for a cancelled / terminated
      `pg_sleep(5)`. On 2026-10-10 the cancel half measured 1.06 s in the
      `pg-oracle` lane, on a PR that changed only the MongoDB server (#1850 or
      #1851; which was not written down), and passed on the re-run. Same shape
      as the reap race that test used to have (fixed: the idle-session reap
      now polls `pg_stat_activity` with a 10 s deadline): a fixed bound
      standing in for "the cancel arrived".

      Practical note: `gh run rerun --failed` is NOT available on this
      workflow (it answers "run ... cannot be rerun; its workflow file may be
      broken"), so a single-lane re-run is not a diagnostic you can reach
      for. Re-triggering means a push, and therefore a full matrix.

- [ ] **Rust PG server: a SAVEPOINT captures whole tables, so its cost is
      the size of what the block writes.** WiredTiger has no savepoint, so
      one here is a set of pre-images: the first write to a table after a
      savepoint copies that table's documents into it. Correct for any size,
      but a savepoint taken before a write to a large table copies the whole
      table into memory. Lazy capture is what keeps the common case free (a
      savepoint nobody writes through costs nothing), and a per-row undo log
      would be the fix if the cost ever bites.

- [ ] **Rust PG server: what the general JOIN planner does not push into
      its table leaves.** A WHERE conjunct that reads ONE alias's columns
      (qualified), built of operators, casts, constants and parameters, is
      applied inside that leaf (only on the PRESERVED side of every outer
      join above it); corpus `join_pushdown`. Not pushed: a conjunct with an
      unqualified column, a function call (it may be volatile), a subquery,
      or one over two aliases. Each such conjunct is filtered only after the
      join, so the leaf cannot use an index for it.

## Warning-class RUSTSEC advisories (surfaced by cargo-audit, not gated) (2026-07-20)

The `cargo-audit` CI gate (`.github/workflows/cargo-audit.yml`) fails only on
*vulnerability*-class advisories; this warning-class one is printed in the
gate log every run but does not block. Not a reachable exploit; clear it when
the TLS dependency chain is next touched:

- **RUSTSEC-2025-0134** — `rustls-pemfile` 2.2.0 unmaintained. Its API folded
  into `rustls-pki-types`. A direct dependency of `secantus-pg` and
  `secantus-pgwire`.
