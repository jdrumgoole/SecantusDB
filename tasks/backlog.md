# Backlog: stubs, stopgaps, and deferred work

A living list of things SecantusDB does not yet implement faithfully. Update when you stub something, when you defer a slice, or when you discover a limitation in production code. Don't add items here that already have a fix in flight — those belong in tasks/todo.md.

Each item should have enough context for a future session to pick it up cold: what's there now, what's missing, why it was deferred.

---

## 1. Stubs (canned responses, no real semantics)

These commands accept the request and return a wire-valid response, but the response is fabricated — they do no real work.

- [ ] **`abortTransaction`** / **`commitTransaction`** — return `{ok: 1}` but **do not roll back**. Operations inside a transaction take effect immediately. Tests that depend on real transactional rollback need a real `mongod`. (Logical sessions ARE tracked end-to-end via ``secantus.sessions.SessionRegistry``; transactions are the next layer up that doesn't yet correlate with session state.)

## 2. Stopgaps (functional but with significant limitations)

These work end-to-end but cut corners.

- [ ] **`_id` numeric type bridge** — works for finite int/float/Decimal128. `bool` is deliberately not numeric. NaN and infinity `_id` values fall through to the BSON-blob path; behavior is unspecified.
- ~~**`renameCollection` cross-process safety**~~ structurally guaranteed by WiredTiger (b34). Within-process atomicity is the storage `RLock`. Cross-process exclusion is `WiredTiger.lock` — a second `wiredtiger_open` on the same path fails with ``WT_ERROR Resource busy`` before any state is touched, so concurrent writers across processes / worktrees can't exist in the first place. See `tests/test_storage_exclusion.py`.
- ~~**`createIndexes` collation**~~ shipped (single-field b25 + compound b27). `sortkey.encode_value_directed` takes a `collation` kwarg; index entries are written under the index's stored collation; single-field equality / range / `$in` (`_find_leading_field_index`), compound bare-equality (`_pick_compound_eq_index`), and compound prefix + trailing-operator (`_pick_compound_range_index`) all thread collation through and gate by exact match. Unique-probe path reads each index's stored collation too. Strength 1/2/3 + `caseLevel` work uniformly across single- and compound-field indexes; `numericOrdering` still falls back to COLLSCAN at every level (would need a length-prefixed digit-run encoding to stay byte-sortable). See `docs/indexes.md` "Per-index collation".

- [ ] **`$exists: true` doesn't use a sparse index (COLLSCAN instead of IXSCAN)** — sparse entries are written and pruned correctly (`_index_key` / `_index_key_variants` skip docs missing the field; present-but-`null` still gets an entry, matching `mongod`), but the planner has no `$exists` branch, so `{f: {$exists: true}}` falls back to a full scan + `matches()`. Correct results, missing fast-path. In real MongoDB a sparse index (or a partial index filtered on `{f: {$exists: true}}`) serves `$exists: true` at IXSCAN; a non-sparse index can't (it has an entry per doc) and `$exists: false` never uses a sparse index. DocumentDB-compatible engines go further — a sparse index is the *only* index path for `$exists: true`. Fix would add a picker that, for a single `{f: {$exists: true}}` clause, walks a sparse (or `$exists`-partial) index over `f` and treats every entry as a hit (no value bound). See `docs/indexes.md` "Sparse indexes and `$exists`" and Franck Pachot's write-up <https://dev.to/franckpachot/exists-and-non-sparse-indexes-in-mongodb-and-in-other-documentdb-19e3>.

## 3. Deferred work (skipped from a slice, ready to come back)

Specific items that were left out of the slice that introduced their feature area.

- [ ] **Admin UI saved-connections / settings page**: Slice 11 of the admin UI shipped schema sampler / logs viewer / geo viewer but skipped the planned `/settings` page with saved Mongo URIs and a manual dark/light toggle. The CLI today takes a single `--uri` per launch, so saved connections are bookmark-only (you can't switch targets after start). When the launcher gains hot-swap support, revisit this page — it's likely a small SQLite-backed list reusing the existing `~/.secantus/admin.db` store.

### 3.1 Authentication

SCRAM-SHA-256 is implemented end-to-end. The wire-protocol shape (saslStart/saslContinue, `hello.saslSupportedMechs`, per-connection auth state, `--auth` gating) is conformant for pymongo and mongo-go-driver. The remaining gaps are mostly orthogonal:

- ~~**MONGODB-X509**~~ — shipped on top of the b22 mTLS slice. Users with `mechanisms: ["MONGODB-X509"]` on `$external` (or `admin`) auth via cert-subject-DN-as-username; no password. The legacy `authenticate` command path (what pymongo / Java / Go / Node use for X509) is wired up alongside `saslStart`. See `docs/authentication.md` "MONGODB-X509" section.
- [ ] **LDAP / Kerberos / GSSAPI / MONGODB-AWS / MONGODB-OIDC** — remaining alternative auth mechanisms. Out of scope for now (each one is its own slice with its own external-system dependency).
- [ ] **Internal cluster auth (keyfile / x509)** — only meaningful with replica sets / sharding, both out of scope.
- ~~**`system.users` collection visibility**~~ shipped (b31). `admin.system.users` is a synthetic read-only view onto the `secantus_users` table; `find` / `aggregate` / `count` surface the stored records with their existing mongod-shaped fields (`_id`, `user`, `db`, `credentials`, `roles`, `mechanisms`). Writes are rejected with code 13 Unauthorized — mutate via `createUser` / `updateUser` / `dropUser`. Other dbs' `system.users` returns empty (matches mongod). See `storage._find_system_users` + `_count_system_users`.
- ~~**`system.version` `authSchema`**~~ shipped (b33). `admin.system.version` is a synthetic read-only view returning a single hard-coded doc: `{_id: "authSchema", currentVersion: 5}` (SCRAM-SHA-256 baseline, MongoDB 4.0+). Tools that read the auth-schema version on startup now get an honest answer. Writes rejected (code 13). See `storage._find_system_version`.

### 3.2 Change-stream limitations

Single-node change streams are implemented and conformant for typical pymongo `watch()` flows, but the following are deferred or intentionally diverge from real `mongod`:

- [ ] **Multi-document transactions in change events** — `txnNumber` and `lsid` are never present on change events; SecantusDB has no real transaction state.
- [ ] **Read concern / write concern semantics** — accepted on the wire for compatibility, otherwise ignored.
- [ ] **Resume-token cross-server identity** — tokens are opaque to pymongo and round-trip fine, but the inner layout is `{s, t, n, k}` (BSON-encoded, hex-stringed) rather than mongod's keystring format. Tokens minted by SecantusDB cannot be presented to a real `mongod`, and vice versa.

## 4. Out of scope (intentional, with reasoning)

These are explicit non-goals. Don't add them without a reason.

- **Real replica sets / sharding** — depend on cluster topology and cross-node consistency. SecantusDB advertises `setName: "secantus"` to satisfy pymongo's change-stream topology check, but the topology is fictional — there are no other members, no elections, no cross-node oplog. Change streams are still in scope (single-node, oplog-backed); see `## 3. Deferred work / Change-stream limitations`.
- ~~Authentication (SCRAM-SHA-256)~~ — implemented. `--auth` (CLI) / `require_auth=True` (constructor) gates non-handshake commands behind a successful `saslStart`/`saslContinue` round-trip. Provision users via `createUser`; manage with `dropUser` / `usersInfo`. The remaining auth gaps are tracked under `## 3. Deferred work / Authentication` below.
- ~~TLS / SSL~~ — implemented in b21+b22. `[tls] cert_file` + `[tls] key_file` enable server-side TLS; `[tls] ca_file` + `[tls] require_client_cert` add mTLS (transport-layer client verification). MONGODB-X509 cert-as-username auth landed in a later slice (see `docs/authentication.md`).
- **`OP_COMPRESSED`** — compression negotiation. Clients can be told the server doesn't support compression; nothing to do.
- **Text search** (`$text`, `$meta: "textScore"`, text indexes) — would need a full-text index implementation.
- **Geo — complete and shipped.** Operators (`$geoWithin` / `$geoIntersects` / `$near` / `$nearSphere`) + `$geoNear` aggregation stage (auto-infer `key`, `includeLocs`), `2dsphere` (S2 cell coverings + ancestors) and `2d` (bit-interleaved geohash with quadtree-decomposed Z-order range covering) index acceleration, compound geo+scalar indexes (geo cell scan + verifier-step filter on trailing scalars), legacy mongod sibling-form `$maxDistance` / `$minDistance` for `$near` / `$nearSphere`, and write-time input validation (out-of-range coordinates / unparseable shapes reject with mongod's documented code 16572 across insert / update / upsert / createIndex). See `src/secantus/geo.py` + `src/secantus/geo_index.py`. **Validation surface**: 79 in-tree pymongo tests in `tests/test_geo*.py`; 3 cross-driver smoke tests through mongosh, mongo-node-driver, and mongo-go-driver in `tests/test_geo_cross_driver.py` (all pass — wire-protocol geo path is clean across drivers); the pymongo conformance gauge keeps `test_collection.py`'s built-in geo tests at 100%; mongo-java-driver's `GeoJsonFiltersFunctionalSpecification` + `GeoFiltersFunctionalSpecification` upstream specs both pass 10/10 in the java gauge's `:driver-core:test` module. **Out of scope**: exact mongod error-string matching (chase work without a clear payoff unless a driver test pins exact wording).
- **`$where`** — runs JavaScript. We don't ship a JS runtime.
- **`$function`, `$accumulator`** (aggregation expressions) — same reason: both evaluate user-supplied JavaScript and need an embedded JS engine + sandbox + BSON↔JS shim layer. Would also require a `--javascriptEnabled` gate (mongod gates JS behind this; many prod deployments disable it). Adding the runtime would let us implement these three operators + `mapReduce` together for ~600–1000 LOC + a heavyweight binary dep (PythonMonkey / QuickJS / V8 — each with maintenance trade-offs). Most pipelines that reach for `$function` can be expressed in the existing aggregation expression library — `$cond` / `$switch` / `$let` / `$map` / `$reduce` / `$filter` / `$regexFind` / `$concat` / `$substrCP` / `$dateToString` / etc. — which is more expressive than people often realise. **`lang: "python"` as a SecantusDB extension was considered and rejected (May 2026)**: would break the conformance contract (CLAUDE.md "pymongo cannot tell SecantusDB apart from mongod" — pipelines that work locally would explode in production with `Unrecognized lang value: 'python'`), and CPython's sandboxing story is actually worse than embedded JS engines (no per-context isolation primitives, no reliable cross-platform CPU-time interrupt, `RestrictedPython` is an AST rewriter not a true sandbox). If a real user need ever surfaces, the right escape hatch is a server-side trusted-plugin registry — `{$secantusFunction: {name: "<pre-registered>", args: [...]}}` — not user code at query time.
- **`mapReduce`** — same JS-runtime dependency as `$where` / `$function` / `$accumulator`. Also explicitly deprecated by MongoDB (removed from the Stable API in 5.0; recommended migration path is aggregation pipelines). `commands._map_reduce` recognises the canonical `emit(this.<field>, 1)` + `values.length` "count by field" pattern (the shape mongo-java-driver's `testMapReduceWithGenerics` test exercises) and translates it to an equivalent `$group` aggregation. Non-canonical map / reduce bodies return `{results: [], ok: 1}` so wire-shape probes pass, and `out: "<coll>"` (non-inline) is rejected with FailedToParse. Anything that genuinely needs JS evaluation needs a real `mongod`.
- ~~Capped collections~~ — implemented. `create capped: true, size, max` accepted; `Storage.insert` and `Storage.update_matching` enforce FIFO eviction by walking the doc table in natural order and evicting oldest non-fresh docs while bounds are exceeded. `listCollections` surfaces `options.{capped,size,max}`. Eviction emits oplog `op:"d"` entries (and pre-images when enabled) so change streams observe the deletes. **Known limitation**: eviction order is `_id_key` natural order, which equals insertion order only when `_id` is monotonic (the default `ObjectId`). With user-supplied non-monotonic `_id` values, eviction does not match strict insertion order — capped users with custom `_id` should not rely on FIFO semantics.
- ~~Profiling~~ — implemented. `profile` command (-1 / 0 / 1 / 2 with `slowms` + `sampleRate`) sets per-database state in `secantus_profile_settings`. Dispatch wraps each non-skip command in `time.monotonic_ns` timing; if the per-DB level matches, an entry is inserted into `<db>.system.profile` (auto-created capped 10 MB). Recursion guard skips ops against `system.profile` itself + handshake / cursor-continuation / profile-itself commands. Entry shape mirrors mongod (`ts`, `op`, `ns`, `command`, `millis`, `ok`, `client`, optional `user`, `errMsg` / `errCode` on failure). Out of scope today: `planSummary` / `keysExamined` / `docsExamined` / `nreturned` (would need post-handler stats plumbing).
- ~~Tailable / awaitData cursors~~ — implemented for change streams (see "In scope" in `CLAUDE.md`). Outside change streams (e.g. capped-collection tailables) still depend on capped-collection support, which remains out of scope.

## 5. Known bugs and edge cases to watch

Subtler than the above; these may bite specific test suites.

- [ ] **Intermittent pytest-xdist worker crash at ~97% of full suite (post-b18).** Surfaced twice on recent CI: once on Linux (76e23e7 config-file b20, hung at 97% for 33 min until cancelled), once on macOS (cada91b probe attempt, gw1 reported "node down: Not properly terminated" at 08:34:10, parent hung for 27 min). Always near the end of the run — implies a slow / heavy test triggers a native-level crash on the worker subprocess (WT segfault, change-stream / WS handler race, or similar). Local darwin: hangs ~1 in 6 runs in isolation but didn't reproduce in 5 consecutive runs after the b20 commit. Probe armed: `test.yml` runs pytest with `--timeout=120 --timeout-method=thread --max-worker-restart=0` so the *next* crash names the test (deadline path) or names the worker + last test (worker-death path). Next CI run that surfaces the crash should be investigated immediately rather than retried.
- ~~**`$type: "int"` / `"long"`**~~ fixed (b29). `_TYPE_PREDS` keys on `isinstance(v, bson.Int64)` rather than Python value range — pymongo's BSON decoder preserves the int32/int64 distinction by class (int32 → plain `int`, int64 → `Int64`), so a doc inserted as `Int64(5)` now matches `$type: "long"` (not `"int"`). `$convert: {to: "long"}` returns `Int64` so its output round-trips correctly through the type predicate.
- [ ] **`$lookup` simple-form-plus-pipeline** — when both `localField`/`foreignField` and `pipeline` are present, we pre-filter by the simple form and then run the pipeline. Real MongoDB does this too in modern versions, but the documentation isn't crystal clear on the order. If a test breaks here, this is the place to look.
- [ ] **Aggregation `$group` stable order** — group buckets are emitted in first-seen order, not sorted. Matches MongoDB for unsharded but might differ from sharded behavior (which we don't model).
- ~~**`apiStrict: true` enforcement Java pool-clear cascade**~~ resolved (0.5.2b3) by narrowing the gate instead of the broad-whitelist invert. A focused `_API_V1_REJECTED_BY_NAME = {"distinct"}` rejects only the canary command the spec's unified runners actively probe (mongo-java-driver `crud-api-version-1-strict.yml` `distinct appends declared API version`). Empirical Java-gauge run: +1 pass for the canary, **zero** new failures and zero pool-clear symptoms across the 900-test suite. The previous cascade theory (broad whitelist would invalidate the pool through SDAM) is correct for the broad path but doesn't trigger from a single command rejection — the broad invert also rejected `count` (used internally by `estimatedDocumentCount`) and other handshake-adjacent admin commands, which is the actual mechanism for the 6 cascade failures, not pool-clear semantics. The narrow gate sidesteps that entirely.
- [ ] **Go gauge flake: `TestIndexView/drop_one` + `drop_all` server-selection timeouts** — each fails after a 30-second `context deadline exceeded` from the driver's server-selection loop, with the topology view showing `Type: Unknown` for `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>`. Surfaced 2026-05-14 in a fresh `validate-all` run that was otherwise clean (Go pass count actually rose 395 → 398, but two new flake fails appeared in their place). Different signature from the `try_next/one_getMore_sent` flake — that one's a wire-shape race, this one's the daemon becoming unreachable mid-test. Hypothesis: resource exhaustion under the validate-all parallel fan-out (all five gauges hit the daemon concurrently), or a per-collection-lock deadlock that pins the connection accept loop. Repro lever: run `validate-all` (not `validate-go` alone) and watch for these two specific subtests under `TestIndexView`. Until reproduced reliably, deferred behind the other Go flake.
- [ ] **Go gauge flake: `TestChangeStream_ReplicaSet/try_next/one_getMore_sent`** — fails intermittently (~1 in 2-3 full gauge runs) with `TryNext returned true on iteration 1`. Test elapsed 0.27s instead of expected 1.01s — i.e. the first `getMore`'s producer call returned non-empty events instead of waiting the full `maxAwaitTimeMS` for nothing to arrive. Repros only under the full gauge load — running just `TestChangeStream_ReplicaSet` in isolation passes 30/30. **Cause unknown after one session.** Ruled out: heartbeats (filtered at `read_oplog` by `_ns_filter` since op=`n` carries ns=`""`); cross-collection `c` events (correctly rejected at `changestreams.project` line ~260 — the projection layer is doing its job even though `_ns_filter` lets `<db>.$cmd` through to it); sequential mtest teardown (synchronous via `testing.T.Cleanup`, so prior subtest cleanup completes before next subtest body runs). **Open theories:** (a) per-coll-lock writes (`storage.py:1749` — `insert` uses `_coll_lock`, not `_lock`) racing with `_lock`-held `oplog_tail_seq()` reads, so reservation can land between a reader's tail snapshot and the reader's first producer call; (b) parallel `Test*` functions (e.g. `TestClient_BSONOptions` and several encryption-prose tests at `client_test.go` / `client_side_encryption_prose_test.go` call top-level `t.Parallel()`) writing to the oplog during our change-stream's await window. The Go gauge also occasionally surfaces `TestCollection/insert_many/large_document_batches` with `write: no buffer space available` — likely the same daemon-overload symptom under parallel test pressure. Three full-gauge runs in May 2026 saw: 100% (1 run), 99.3% (1 run, the original baseline; just this flake firing), 98.5% (1 run, this flake + the buffer-space symptom). Both flake patterns deserve a dedicated session with reliable repro before patching.
- [ ] **Ruby gauge: `Index::View#create_one with session` test client-side-stripped** — mongo-ruby-driver's `Mongo::Index::View#create_one when provided a session behaves like a failed operation using a session raises an error` test passes `view.create_one(spec, invalid: true)` and expects an `OperationFailure` to come back from the server. But the Ruby driver's `Options::Mapper.transform` filters the model hash against its `OPTIONS` whitelist (`lib/mongo/index/view.rb:61`) **before** the command is built, so `invalid: true` never reaches the wire. We added unknown-spec-option rejection on `createIndexes` (`commands.py:_INDEX_SPEC_KNOWN_OPTIONS` + the `Location40415` gate in `_create_indexes`) which DOES fire when the option arrives, so this is a working server-side guard — the test is just structurally broken against modern Ruby drivers. Real mongod has the same problem; the test would need the driver to keep `invalid: true` in the spec for the server-side rejection path to be reachable. Documented and accepted.
- [ ] **Ruby gauge: `applies the write concern passed in as an option` expected-fail under single-node topology** — mongo-ruby-driver's `Mongo::Collection#create ... when write concern passed in as an option` test (`spec/mongo/collection_ddl_spec.rb:211`) explicitly passes `w: 2` to `collection.create` and expects success — it assumes the canonical multi-node replica-set test cluster the Ruby driver's CI runs against. SecantusDB advertises as a single-node `secantus` replica set, so `w: 2` produces a `writeConcernError` (code 100, `CannotSatisfyWriteConcern`) — added in `commands.py:_unsatisfiable_wc_error` + dispatch wire-up. This is the correct mongod emulation; the test is structurally incompatible with our topology. **Net trade-off was +7 Ruby gauge passes**: seven `applies the write concern` tests that pass `INVALID_WRITE_CONCERN = {w: 4000}` and expect `OperationFailure` now pass because of the wce, this one test now fails. If the test cluster ever grows past 1 advertised member, this test will start passing organically.

## 6. Admin UI review punch list

End-to-end review of the secantus-admin web UI on `main` (May 2026, before the `admin-ui` branch lands its next slice). Severity tiers: P0 broken/silently-wrong, P1 inconsistency or significant usability gap, P2 polish. File refs are absolute under `src/secantus/admin/` unless noted.

### P0 — broken / silently wrong

(None at present.)

### P1 — significant inconsistency / usability

- [ ] **`/backup/dump` and `/backup/restore` long-task UX** — calls `backup_lib.run_mongodump` / `run_mongorestore` synchronously. Spinner + disabled button covers the visible UX gap for normal-sized dumps; the ideal version is a real background-task wrapper with poll status so the user can navigate away during multi-minute dumps of large collections. Not load-bearing — defer until someone actually hits a multi-minute dump.

### P2 — polish

- [ ] **Admin UI polish bundle** — small fixes that don't deserve individual entries; address opportunistically when touching nearby code. (Currently no entries — the bundle was cleared in `admin-ui-rest`, May 2026. Drop new ones here as they show up.)

## 7. Python → Rust rewrite (in progress)

Tracking the incremental rewrite (plan: `tasks/rust-rewrite-plan.md`; Phase 0
spike results: `tasks/rust-rewrite-spike-findings.md`). The Rust core lives at
`crates/secantus-core` and builds as an abi3 extension `_secantus_core` via
maturin (`invoke rust-build` / `rust-test` / `rust-parity`).

**Both engines are permanent (not a replacement).** The pure-Python engines are
always present and the default; the Rust core is an optional accelerator.
Selection is process-wide via `secantus.engine` (the `SECANTUS_ENGINE` env var
/ `SecantusDBServer(engine=...)` / `--engine`), with per-component overrides
(`SECANTUS_RUST_<COMPONENT>`). So the old "flip the default to Rust" items below
mean "make Rust the *recommended* default for users who install the extension,"
never "remove Python."

- [x] **Engine selection** — `secantus.engine` is the single source of truth
  (`available()` / `selected()` / `set_engine()` / `enabled(component)`); all six
  shims consult it; `SecantusDBServer(engine=)` + `--engine` set it. Unit-tested
  by `tests/test_engine.py` (WT-independent).
- [x] **Phase 0 spikes** — BSON fidelity, WiredTiger FFI, sortkey golden
  vectors all green (`rust/`, `rust/run_spikes.sh`).
- [x] **Phase 1, leaf engine #1: `sortkey`** — ported to Rust behind the fat
  byte seam; pure-Python `secantus.sortkey` delegates when
  `SECANTUS_RUST_SORTKEY=1`. Parity pinned by `tests/test_rust_sortkey_parity.py`
  (curated + 2000-case fuzz, byte-identical).
- [ ] **Make Rust the *recommended* default (Python stays available).**
  Currently every component defaults to Python; `SECANTUS_ENGINE=rust` opts in.
  Recommending Rust by default for extension-having installs requires: (a) the
  extension shipped in the wheel (Phase 6 packaging — two native build systems
  to merge), and (b) a decision on the byte seam's per-call
  `bson.encode({"v": value})` overhead vs passing values without re-encoding.
  The Python engine remains a permanent, selectable mode regardless.
- [x] **Collation (query matcher).** `crates/secantus-core/src/collation.rs`
  implements the ASCII-safe, Unicode-version-independent cases (case-insensitive
  ASCII = ASCII-lowercase; accent-strip is a no-op on ASCII; strength-3 identity
  handles any string); threaded through the Rust query matcher's string `$eq`/
  `$ne`/`$gt`/`$gte`/`$lt`/`$lte`/`$in`/`$nin`. `query.matches` now delegates to
  Rust *with* a collation, which defers to Python for non-ASCII-under-transform
  and `numericOrdering`. Parity: `tests/test_rust_query_parity.py` collation
  cases + 4000-case fuzz.
- [x] **Collation-aware sortkey in Rust.** `sortkey.encode_value` /
  `encode_value_directed` thread a collation through to the Rust encoder
  (`collation::normalize_index_bytes`, where `numericOrdering` is the raw-bytes
  identity — matching Python's `_encode_string` skipping normalisation when
  `supports_index_encoding` is false). ASCII normalisation is reproduced;
  non-ASCII transforms defer to Python. Parity:
  `tests/test_rust_sortkey_parity.py` collation cases.
- [x] **Phase 1, leaf engine #2: `query.matches`** — common operators ported
  to Rust (`crates/secantus-core/src/query.rs` + `numeric.rs`) behind the byte
  seam; `secantus.query.matches` delegates when `SECANTUS_RUST_QUERY=1` (now
  including collation — see the collation item above). The Rust matcher returns
  `None` (→ pure-Python fallback) for anything not reproduced faithfully:
  `$jsonSchema`, geo,
  **any regex**, `$all`, structural/compound equality (array/doc operands),
  bool-as-int comparison, exotic BSON types. Parity pinned by
  `tests/test_rust_query_parity.py` (curated + 6000-case fuzz).
- [ ] **Widen the Rust query matcher** — `$all` is now handled (element
  equality via `expressions::py_eq`; regex elements still defer). Remaining
  fallbacks to widen where faithful: bool-as-int `$gt`/`$lt` comparison and
  structural array/doc equality (both need Python's exact quirky semantics).
- [ ] **Flip `query.matches` default to Rust** — same gating as sortkey
  (Phase 6 packaging + the per-call `bson.encode` overhead question). Note the
  matcher re-encodes doc+query per call at the seam; the real win needs the doc
  to already be bytes at the call site (it is, in storage — wire that through
  when the boundary moves outward).
- [x] **Phase 1, leaf engine #3: `update.apply_update`** — the common
  deterministic operators ported to Rust (`crates/secantus-core/src/update.rs`,
  with the `secantus.paths` dotted-path helpers): replacement-style, `$set`,
  `$setOnInsert`, `$unset`, `$inc`, `$mul`, `$push`, `$pop`, `$rename`, plus
  `_id` immutability. `secantus.update.apply_update` delegates when
  `SECANTUS_RUST_UPDATE=1`. Returns `None` (→ pure-Python fallback) for pipeline
  (array) updates, positional ops / array filters, `$currentDate`,
  `$min`/`$max`/`$pull`/`$addToSet`/`$bit`, Decimal128/non-numeric arithmetic,
  and every error condition (so the exact `UpdateError`/`PathError` is raised by
  Python). Parity pinned by `tests/test_rust_update_parity.py` (curated +
  6000-case fuzz).
- [ ] **Widen the Rust update matcher** to cover current fallbacks where
  faithful: `$min`/`$max` (Python `<` cross-type / raise semantics),
  `$pull`/`$addToSet` (Python `==` membership incl. bool-as-int and structural),
  `$bit`. Each needs care to match Python's exact semantics.
- [ ] **BEFORE flipping `update` default to Rust: verify field-order on $set of
  an existing key.** Python `set_path` assigns in place (preserves dict position
  of an existing field); confirm `bson::Document::insert` on an existing key
  also preserves position rather than moving it to the end — otherwise a
  flipped default would reorder fields vs mongod. (Parity test uses dict `==`,
  which is order-insensitive, so it wouldn't catch this; the full WiredTiger
  conformance suite would.)
- [x] **Phase 1, leaf engine #4: `expressions.evaluate`** — a high-value core of
  the aggregation expression language ported to Rust
  (`crates/secantus-core/src/expressions.rs`): field paths / `$$var` / `$$ROOT` /
  `$literal`; comparison (`$eq`/`$ne`/`$gt`/`$gte`/`$lt`/`$lte`); logic
  (`$and`/`$or`/`$not`); control flow (`$cond`/`$ifNull`/`$switch`); arithmetic
  (`$add`/`$subtract`/`$multiply`/`$divide`/`$mod`); and common array ops
  (`$size`/`$arrayElemAt`/`$first`/`$last`/`$concatArrays`/`$reverseArray`/`$in`).
  `secantus.expressions.evaluate` delegates when `SECANTUS_RUST_EXPR=1`. Because
  expressions are recursive, the evaluator returns `None` (whole-call fallback)
  if ANY operator/value in the tree isn't ported. Parity pinned by
  `tests/test_rust_expressions_parity.py` (curated + 8000-case nested fuzz).
  **This also unlocked `$expr` in the Rust query matcher** (it now calls the Rust
  evaluator directly, Rust->Rust) — `query_matches` gained a `vars` arg threaded
  through `$expr`.
- [ ] **Widen the Rust expression evaluator** — now also handled:
  `$slice`/`$indexOfArray`; ASCII `$concat`/`$toLower`/`$toUpper`/`$strLenCP`/
  `$split`/`$substrCP`; `$mergeObjects`/`$objectToArray`; the scope-introducing
  `$let`/`$map`/`$filter`/`$reduce`; and UTC date component extractors
  (`$year`/`$month`/`$dayOfMonth`/`$hour`/`$minute`/`$second`/`$dayOfWeek` +
  `$dateToParts`, via a dependency-free civil-date algorithm); a safe subset of
  conversions (`$toInt`/`$toDouble`/`$toBool`/`$toString` for numbers/bools/
  strings); exactly-deterministic math (`$abs`/`$floor`/`$ceil`/`$sqrt`); and
  `$range`/`$strLenBytes`/`$arrayToObject`. Remaining whole-call fallbacks to
  widen where faithful: the heavier date ops (`$dateToString`/`$dateAdd`/
  `$dateDiff`/`$dateTrunc`/`$dateFromString` — timezones, `strftime`, month
  arithmetic); `$round`/`$pow`/`$trunc` (rounding mode) and transcendental math
  (`$exp`/`$ln`/`$log`/`$log10` — last-ULP divergence risk vs Python's libm);
  the conversion edges deferred above (Decimal128, string→number parsing, float
  `str()`, `$convert`/`$toDecimal`); `$getField`/`$setField`; `$zip`/
  `$sortArray` (sortArray uses Python `sorted()` ordering/stability + raises on
  mixed types); and non-ASCII case / default-whitespace `$trim` (defer for
  Unicode-fidelity safety). Regex ops (`$regexMatch`/…) need Python `re`. Done
  this round: `$indexOfCP`/`$indexOfBytes`/`$substrBytes`/`$strLenBytes`/
  `$trim`/`$ltrim`/`$rtrim` (explicit-chars).
- [x] **Phase 1, leaf engine #5: `projection.apply_projection`** — inclusion /
  exclusion / `$slice` / `$elemMatch` projection shapes ported to Rust
  (`crates/secantus-core/src/projection.rs`). `secantus.projection` delegates
  when `SECANTUS_RUST_PROJECTION=1`; returns `None` for mixed inclusion/exclusion
  (Python raises), nested-document specs, unusual `$slice` arg types, and
  `$elemMatch` sub-filters the matcher defers. Parity:
  `tests/test_rust_projection_parity.py` (curated + 6000-case fuzz).
- [x] **Phase 1, leaf engine #6: `diff.compute_update_description`** — the
  change-stream `$v: 2` update diff ported to Rust
  (`crates/secantus-core/src/diff.rs`), reusing the expression engine's Python-`==`
  semantics. `secantus.diff` delegates when `SECANTUS_RUST_DIFF=1`; defers on
  Decimal128 / exotic values. Parity: `tests/test_rust_diff_parity.py` (curated +
  6000-case fuzz).
- [ ] **Shared path write helpers** (`set_path`/`unset_path`) now live in
  `paths.rs` alongside the read helpers; `update.rs` keeps a thin `Fallback`-
  mapping wrapper. (Note for the eventual default-flip: same `bson::Document`
  field-order question as the update engine applies to projection/diff outputs.)
- [ ] **All six leaf engines are ported.** Remaining Phase-1 work is `collation`
  (unlocks the collation fallbacks across sortkey/query) and *widening* the
  already-ported engines (see the per-engine "widen" items above). After that,
  Phase 2+ (aggregate, storage, wire/dispatch) per tasks/rust-rewrite-plan.md.

### Two latent `sortkey` bugs fixed while porting (now Python == Rust == mongod)

Found by the parity test; both changed the **on-disk index-key bytes** for the
affected values (immaterial for ephemeral test data, but note it):

- **Date keys** used `int(total_seconds() * 1000)`, a float path that rounded
  sub-second values off by up to 1ms vs the integer millis BSON actually stores
  (and mongod sorts by). Now integer-exact.
- **Regex keys** did `bytes(r.flags)`, which — because a BSON-round-tripped
  `Regex.flags` is an *int* — produced N NUL bytes instead of the option string
  (e.g. flags=10 → ten NULs instead of `"im"`). Now reconstructs the option
  chars in pymongo's on-wire order (`ilmsux`).
